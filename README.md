# Data-manipulation-for-Darshboard-VFP

This program was made on Visual Fox Pro to extract and manipulate information of an ERP software to create new tables that summarise infromati√≥n of different company areas to use them to create Graphs and KPI with the "Shiny Dashboard" library in R.

The main Tables this program creates are:

Sales, Purchases, Clients, Account payable, Account receivable, Cash Flow, Products, Agents, Receivable Department, Warehouse

All the tables have the main fields that allows the user to make linear, pie, bar, and all types of graphs, also are included the fields in which the information will be filtered.
